# Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

1. Defining the apps environment with `Dockerfile`.
2. Defining the services that make up app in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Start and run application service with `docker-compose up`.

Details can be studied from docker official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
